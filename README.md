# Hi Mobile Devs 

**Note:** Plese read the notes and instructions below before starting the development.

# Conventions

## Folders
* naming folders must be small cases and separated with dash "-" if more than one word (eg. custom-components).

## Files
* naming Class or Functional components files must be first letter capitalized with no spaces or separator (eg. NewBackground.tsx) should follow .tsx format.
* naming utility or normal files must be all small case and separated with dash "-" if more than one word (eg. money-converter.ts) should follow .ts format.
* naming mock files should be all capitalized and separated with underscore "-" if more than one word (eg. MOCK_FILES).

## Code Function names
* naming utility/helper functions must be camelcase (eg. function newMeta() )
* naming Class or Functional components must be first letter capitalized with no spaces or separator (eg. class ExampleButton)

# BEST PRACTICES

* Always use folder indexing on the **HEAD** folder.
* Please maximize the usage of **typescript** on the code.
* Add comments to complicated and unfinish code.
* 

# TIPS

* for faster debugging use commands "npm run log-android" or "npm run log-ios"  to log all "console.log" into terminal
